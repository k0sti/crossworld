# Button Visibility Test

## Changes Made

1. Increased reserved space for bottom UI: `100.0` → `120.0`
2. Made button more prominent:
   - Fixed size: 120px × 28px
   - Larger text: 14.0 size
   - White color for better visibility
3. Reduced spacing before button: `8.0` → `4.0`

## Expected Behavior

You should now see a clearly visible **"Send & Exit"** button below the review comment text field.

The button should:
- Be 120 pixels wide and 28 pixels tall
- Have white text at size 14
- Be clickable to submit your review and exit

## Test

Type something in the comment field and click the button to test.
